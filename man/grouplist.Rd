\title{Build sibling/cousin group index lists from CME column names}
\usage{
grouplist(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric (or logical) matrix whose column names encode main effects
and CMEs using the convention \code{"<Main>|<Cond>+"} and
\code{"<Main>|<Cond>-"} for conditional effects, and \code{"<Main>"}
for standalone main effects.}
}
\value{
A named list of integer vectors. Each element contains 1-based column indices
into \code{X} for the corresponding group.
}
\description{
Creates index groups for \strong{siblings} and \strong{cousins} based on a design
matrix whose columns are main effects (e.g., \code{"A"}) and conditional main
effects (CMEs) named like \code{"A|B+"} or \code{"A|B-"}.
For each effect name \code{E}, this returns:
\itemize{
\item \code{S<E>} — indices of columns where \code{E} is the \strong{main} effect
(the ME column \code{"E"} itself, and all CMEs \code{"E|*+/-"}).
\item \code{C<E>} — indices of columns where \code{E} appears as the
\strong{conditioning} effect (all CMEs \code{"*|E+/-"} and the ME \code{"E"}).
}
}
\details{
Group names are constructed as \code{"S<effect>"} and \code{"C<effect>"}.
Effects are taken from the column-name substrings before/after \code{"|"} with
any trailing sign \code{"+"} or \code{"-"} removed for the conditioning effect.
If an effect appears only as a conditioner (never as a standalone ME column),
its \code{C<effect>} group is still created and populated.
