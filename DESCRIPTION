Title: Adaptive Bi-Level Variable Selection of Conditional Main Effects for Generalized Linear Models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kexin Xie
Maintainer: Kexin Xie <kexinx@vt.edu>
Description: Provides functions for implementing glmcmenet - a bi-level variable selection method for conditional main effects for generalized linear regression. CMEs are reparametrized interaction effects which capture the conditional impact of a factor at a fixed level of another factor. Compared to traditional two-factor interactions, CMEs can quantify more interpretable interaction effects in many problems. The current implementation performs variable selection on only binary CMEs; we are working on an extension for the continuous setting.
